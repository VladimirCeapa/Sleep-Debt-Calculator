# Sleep-Debt-Calculator

sleep deficit calculator, enter your data and check if you are sleeping the required amount of hours

Did you know that giraffes only sleep 4.6 hours a day? We humans need more than that. If we don't sleep enough,
we accumulate a sleep deficit. In this project, we will calculate whether you are getting enough 
sleep each week using a sleep deficit calculator. The schedule will determine the actual and ideal 
hours of sleep for each night of the last week. Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal.
